## Project Overview
Our project aims to create a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** that can identify skin cancer in patients using images of affected areas. We will utilize the **ISIC 2024 Challenge** dataset, provided by Kaggle, which contains a wide range of dermoscopic images for skin cancer diagnosis. This Project was created as our finals project for **Deep Learning in Practice with Python and LUA** class at **BME VIK**.

For more information about the dataset, you can visit the competition page on Kaggle: [ISIC 2024 Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/isic-2024-challenge).

## Repository Structure
- **DeepLearning-Homework.ipynb**: All of the data, model and file downloads are centralized in one Jupyter Notebook
